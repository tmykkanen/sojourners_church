We've listened to the Preacher's message. We've walked with him through the ruins of Eden and looked under every rock we can think of for purpose and meaning and lasting gain. And everything has come up short; "all is vanity" (Eccl 1:2; 12:8).

But along the way, the Preacher has been pointing us towards true purpose and meaning and gain. And here, at the end, the narrator makes this explicit: "The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." (Eccl 12:13).

Listen to this sermon and the Preacher's simple conclusion and ask "how can we learn to fear God and keep his commandments during our brief days under the sun?"
