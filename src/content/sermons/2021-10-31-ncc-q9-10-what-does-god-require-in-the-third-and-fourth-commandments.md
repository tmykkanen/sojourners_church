This sermon continues our walk through the New City Catechism and is the third sermon in our series on the Ten Commandments.

Q: What does God require in the third and fourth commandments?

A: Third, that we treat God’s name with fear and reverence, honoring also his Word and works. Fourth, that on the Sabbath day we spend time in public and private worship of God, rest from routine employment, serve the Lord and others, and so anticipate the eternal Sabbath.
