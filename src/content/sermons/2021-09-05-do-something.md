Farming in Eden was certain. Sowing, reaping, and enjoying the harvest was a sure thing. But in the ruins of Eden, living under the sun in a creation cursed because of sin, much is uncertain. Crops die and ships sink. How do we live faithfully in a world with so much uncertainty? That's the theme of this text from Ecclesiastes.
