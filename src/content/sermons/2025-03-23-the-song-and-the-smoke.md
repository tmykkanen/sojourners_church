Sermon on Revelation 15:1–8 from
[⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Sojourners Church⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠](http://sojourners.church/)
in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on March 23rd, 2025 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: God displays his glory in salvation through judgment.

1. Singing is the right response to God's judgment

2. Because both salvation and judgment display God's glory.
