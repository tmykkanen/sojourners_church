This passage is at the same time one of the bluntest looks at the reality of death in Ecclesiastes and one of the strongest exhortations to enjoying life. How can these two things fit together? How do we enjoy life knowing that everything we love will eventually be taken from us by death?

That question reveals the heart of the promises of the gospel. It's against the dark backdrop of our own mortality that the promises of the gospel shine brightly—bright enough even that we can receive life's good as a gift from God to be enjoyed.
