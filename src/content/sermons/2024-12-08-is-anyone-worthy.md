Sermon on Revelation 5:1–14 from
[⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Sojourners Church⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠](http://sojourners.church/)
in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on December 8, 2024 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: Jesus is worthy of all honor because of HOW he triumphs over tragedy.

1. Tragedy: One man weeping (vv. 1–4)

2. Triumph: All creation rejoicing (vv. 5–14)
