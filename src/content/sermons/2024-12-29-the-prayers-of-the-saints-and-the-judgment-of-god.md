Sermon on Revelation 8:1–13 from
[⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Sojourners Church⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠](http://sojourners.church/)
in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on December 29, 2024 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: God brings judgment on His enemies in response to the prayers of His people.

1. Prayers Rise Up

2. Judgment Rains Down

3. How then should we pray?
