So many of the daily challenges we face in this world do not have "chapter and verse" that tell us what to do. We need to learn to live skillfully in this world under the sun. That's where wisdom comes in. We need wisdom, but how do we get and use wisdom? That's the theme of this text from Ecclesiastes.
