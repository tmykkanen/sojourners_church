Sermon on 1 Thessalonians 1:1-10 from ⁠Sojourners Church⁠ in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on September 14, 2025 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: When the gospel comes to town, it's obvious.

We know God has chosen you (v. 4) because of...

1. The way the gospel came to you.

2. The way you welcomed the gospel.

3. The way the gospel went out from you.
