As Christians, we know this world is not our home. We await a better home and a Good King. But in the meantime we live in the ruins of Eden, in a world filled with rebellion against King Jesus.

The Preacher in Ecclesiastes saw this world in rebellion and observed: "Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 8:10) How do God's people live wisely in a wicked culture like that? That's the theme of our text today.
