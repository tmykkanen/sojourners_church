[⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Sojourners Church⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠](http://sojourners.church/)
in Albert Lea, MN. Preached on February 9th, 2025 by Pastor Tyler Mykkanen.

Argument: The Devil is Defeated but Dangerous.

1. The Devil is Disappointed, Disgraced, and Desperate.

2. The Devil can't win, but he's still gonna try.

3. Conquer a Defeated but Dangerous Devil by the Blood of the Lamb and the Word of Your Testimony.
