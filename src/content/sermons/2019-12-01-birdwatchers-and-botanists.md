### Sermon Preview

This Sunday, we begin our advent series “Delighting in the Generosity of God.” I’m really excited for this series because I often forget how generous God is. I bet many of you are the same. We desperately need to be reminded. Many of you are in the same boat. Whether you’ve received plenty and drift into forgetting the Giver or whether you have lack and doubt the generosity of the Giver, I’m confident that this sermon series will stir your heart to delight in God’s generosity towards you this Christmas season.

We'll start by looking at Luke 12. We'll see how our preoccupation with “enoughness” has caused us to forget the God of more than enough. Because we see scarcity all around us, we believe and live by the story that there is not enough. We think that by securing enough for us and ours we can be safe and satisfied.

But that’s not the story Jesus believes and lives by. He calls us to be birdwatchers and botanists as we consider the generosity of the God of the Garden. Jesus wants us to pay attention to His story—the story of a God who gave and still gives. And Jesus wants us to live like we believe it by casting aside anxious worry and mimicking the generosity of our creator.

We’ll start unpacking this story this weekend and continue through the advent season. Would you join us this Sunday at 10 am? Let’s delight in the generosity of God together.
