### Sermon Preview

“Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” This is the heart of the gospel and it’s at the center of Paul’s testimony of the mercy and grace Jesus has shown him. Paul marvels that he has been entrusted with the gospel, even though he is the chief of sinners and a former persecutor of the church. He bookends his testimony with thanksgiving and praise as he reflects on why and how Jesus’s mercy came to him.

This weekend, we too will reflect on why and how Jesus’s mercy came to Paul and why and how Jesus’s mercy comes to us. We’ll be reminded of the simple gospel—Jesus came into the world to save sinners–and the profound and far reaching impact of that truth. Lord willing, our hearts too will sing with praise: “To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.” Would you join us this Sunday at 10am at the Skyline plaza to glory in the mercy of Jesus?
