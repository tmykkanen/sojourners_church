[Sermon on the Q&A 8 from the New City Catechism:](https://newcitycatechism.com/new-city-catechism/#8)

Q: What is the law of God stated in the Ten Commandments?

A: You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below—you shall not bow down to them or worship them. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Honor your father and your mother. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony. You shall not covet.

**Note, this sermon kicks off a brief series on the Ten Commandments.**
