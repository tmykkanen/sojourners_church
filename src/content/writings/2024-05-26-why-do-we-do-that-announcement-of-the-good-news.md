The good news—or gospel—is the center of the Christian life. Jesus saves sinners. We never outgrow our need to hear this news. We spend our entire lives learning the universe-shaking ramifications of it. And all who believe it will spend eternity growing in our enjoyment of everything that is ours in Jesus. The Announcement of Good News is one of the most joyful and beautiful parts of our liturgy. Having confessed the magnitude of our sins, God meets us with overwhelming mercy and reminds us afresh of the hope we have. We hear this good news from the only unfailing source—God's Word. The reader urges those who do not believe to believe and experience the joy found only in Jesus. And the reader assures those who believe that there is no condemnation for those who are in Jesus. Through this good news, God assures us that we are embraced, forgiven, and strengthened to live a renewed life.
