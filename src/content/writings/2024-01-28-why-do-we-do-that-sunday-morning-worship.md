Our Sunday morning service is the pinnacle of our week as we enter into dialogue with the Lord of the universe. On our own, we are separated from Christ, alienated from his people, and strangers to the covenants of promise—without hope and without God. And yet, our great God does not leave us in our hopelessness. He speaks light into our darkness in the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, we gather weekly to hear God speak the gospel of Jesus to us in his Word and in the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. And we gather to respond in faith as we pray, read, and sing God’s Word together.
