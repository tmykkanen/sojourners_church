After hearing God speak through his Word and call us to worship, we respond with the Prayer of Invocation. In this prayer, we invoke or "call upon" God to work powerfully through his Spirit during the worship service. By responding to the Call to Worship with prayer, we express our longing for God and our deep and humble dependence upon him. In this prayer, we begin the dialogue with God that characterizes Christian worship—he speaks to us through his Word read and preached and we respond to him in prayer and song and sacrament.
