Last week, I introduced the idea of Catechism Sundays. Beginning this January, we will start a new pattern of preaching through the [_New City Catechism_](http://newcitycatechism.com/) on the last Sunday of every month. In the next three weeks, I will write about some of the benefits of learning a catechism. Let these benefits stir you to take full advantage of this helpful discipleship and devotional tool.

## **Benefit #1: Catechisms promote sound doctrine**

The first benefit I want to discuss is that catechisms promote sound doctrine. As we've studied the Letters to Timothy and Titus, we've seen the importance of sound doctrine again and again. Elders are to instruct the church in sound doctrine because sound doctrine accords with godliness and holds forth the promise of eternal life in Christ Jesus ([Titus 1:9](https://ref.ly/Titus%201.9;esv?t=biblia); [2:11](https://ref.ly/Titus%202.11;esv?t=biblia)). We do this by opening and explaining scripture.

In one sense, scripture is straightforward. Take [John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John%203.16;esv?t=biblia) for example. _"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believed in him should not perish but have eternal life."_ This verse is a favorite of many for good reason. In this verse, we see the promise of the gospel in simple terms. But in order to understand and explain what John wrote, we must answer a few questions such as: (1) Who is God?, (2) Who is the Son?, (3) What does it mean to "believe in him"?, (4) Why are we perishing?, and (5) What is eternal life?

**Here we see that even the most basic doctrines exist in a web of doctrinal complexity.** This is not over-complicating scripture; this is just acknowledging that God gave us not _verses,_ but chapters and books and whole testaments. One way to answer the question "Who is God?" is to read the entire Bible. Another way to answer that question is to summarize the teaching of the whole Bible on that question—that's what the catechism does.

According to the New City Catechism, _"God is the creator and sustainer of everyone and everything. He is eternal, infinite, and unchangeable in his power and perfection, goodness and glory, wisdom, justice, and truth. Nothing happens except through him and by his will."_ This means that the God who loves the world also created and sustains the world—and that affects how we understand his love for the world and the sending of his Son. In this way, **the catechism gives context to the sound doctrine we teach from the scriptures.**

Obviously the catechism's description of God is not exhaustive (he is infinite after all!). But it provides a starting point to act as guard rails, so to speak, for our reading, interpretation, preaching, and hearing of scripture. In this way, a sound catechism faithful to the teaching of scripture will promote sound doctrine within the church, giving us a solid foundation on which to read and understand the Bible.

Next week, we'll expand on this idea as we think about the way catechisms promote evangelism and discipleship.
