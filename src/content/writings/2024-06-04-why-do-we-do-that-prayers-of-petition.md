Having heard the Good News and expressed our desire to walk in a manner worthy of the gospel, we naturally turn to prayer. The Prayers of Petition express our continued dependence upon God's grace. We offer prayers to God in obedience and in confidence that God will give what is good. In interceding for others, we join Jesus in his ministry of intercession—remembering that the Good news calls us to love both God and neighbor. We all participate as the leader prays on behalf of the entire congregation. Our pattern at Sojourners is to pray for a member household, a local gospel partner, and a global gospel partner. We also pray for specific community needs as they arise. We conclude the prayer by asking God's aid as we prepare to hear from him in his Word. In praying these prayers together on Sunday morning, we also stir our hearts to continued prayer during the week.
