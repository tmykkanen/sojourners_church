Starting in January, we will begin a new pattern in the preaching at Sojourners. On the last Sunday of every month, we will preach a question and answer from the [New City Catechism](http://newcitycatechism.com/).

## What is a catechism?

Catechism comes from a Greek word for teaching. At the beginning of his gospel, Luke says to Theophilus that he is writing _"that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught (katechethes)."_ Likewise in [Acts 18:25](https://ref.ly/Acts%2018.25;esv?t=biblia), _"Apollos had been instructed (katechemenos) in the way of the Lord."_ Both Theophilus and Apollos were catechized in a summary of doctrine ("the _things_ you have been taught" and "the _way_ of the Lord"). **This is what catechesis is: systematic religious instruction in "the way of the Lord."**

Throughout church history, local churches have summarized the teachings of scripture in statements of faith (or confessions). These confessions were then taught to the congregation. Catechisms put the confessions into question and answer format. This made it easier for God's people to learn doctrine and to see how it all fits together.

## Are catechisms biblical?

Sometimes, people wonder if catechisms are biblical. After all, shouldn't we only teach the Bible? However, catechisms have strong biblical precedent. We've seen in Paul's letters to Timothy and Titus the call to guard the good deposit. Paul calls Timothy to charge false teachers not to teach a different doctrine ([1 Tim 1:3](https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%201.3;esv?t=biblia)), to guard the deposit entrusted to him ([1 Tim 6:20](https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%206.20;esv?t=biblia)), and to follow the pattern of the sound words he's heard ([2 Tim 1:13](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%201.13;esv?t=biblia)). And from its earliest days, the church has devoted itself to the apostles' teaching ([Acts 2:42](https://ref.ly/Acts%202.42;esv?t=biblia)).

These passages do not refer only to the written text of scripture. Rather, the "pattern of the sound words" means a summary of the teachings of the apostles consistent with the teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament. To teach _"the whole counsel of God"_ then, means to continue to teach in this pattern ([Acts 20:27](https://ref.ly/Acts%2020.27;esv?t=biblia)). Catechesis (teaching a catechism) is one way to continue this pattern.

## Why the New City Catechism?

Historically, catechisms served three purposes in the church: (1) to comprehensively summarize the gospel, (2) to form the church into a distinct, counter-cultural, Christ-like identity, and (3) to address and refute particular errors threatening the church. These aims mean that catechisms are both timeless (because the gospel is unchanging) and exist in a particular historical context (because cultures and errors change over time). Since catechisms are timeless, the core content remains the same. But since catechisms exist in a historical context, new catechisms can be written to place historic truths in contemporary context.

We considered several faithful and comprehensive historic catechisms to study together including An Orthodox Catechism and A Baptist Catechism. These catechisms have served the church well and are beautiful, faithful summaries of scripture's teaching.

However, since we plan to preach through the catechism, we felt these were too long and comprehensive to be helpful. The New City Catechism is shorter and more limited in scope to core doctrines like the Trinity and the plan of redemption. Yet, it is rooted in the rich tradition of historic catechisms. The New City Catechism is based on Calvin's Geneva Catechism, the Westminster Shorter and Larger catechisms, and the Heidelberg Catechism.

Studying the New City Catechism also enables families to use some [helpful resources for personal learning](http://newcitycatechism.com/). Families can purchase a physical copy of the catechism, use a web browser to study, or download a free smartphone app. The catechism also includes shorter answers for young children to memorize. This accessibility makes the catechism very easy to use for family worship and discipleship.

## What can we do to prepare?

Over the next several weeks, we will post more articles discussing the benefits of studying the catechism together. Read those articles and let God stir your heart to long for the fruit that comes from studying his Word and works this way together.

On January 31st, we will consider the first question and answer together:

> _Q: What is our only hope in life and death?_

> _A: That we are not our own but belong, body and soul, both in life and death, to God and to our Savior Jesus Christ._

To prepare your heart, we encourage you to read and think over this question and answer in the coming weeks. Consider memorizing it. Discuss together what it means to belong to God and why that gives us hope in life and death. Doing this will prepare us to consider this together on the last Sunday of January. If we do this together as a church, we are confident that God will use it to bear much fruit in our faith and in our daily lives.
