## Introduction

This post continues our walk through the proposed constitution and bylaws. This series aims to draw attention to specific details in the documents and provide an opportunity for questions and feedback.

Today, we will discuss Article 3: Doctrine.

In the last post, we saw that the foundation of Sojourners Church is and always will be Jesus, who rules his church through his word—the Holy Scriptures. As we read and seek to understand the Scriptures, we often summarize our understanding in statements of doctrine. This section of the constitution outlines those statements and how they relate to one another and the life of the church.

## Doctrinal Essentials vs. Distinctives

Notice first, sections 1 and 2 distinguish between Doctrinal Essentials and Doctrinal Distinctives. This distinction is important. Doctrinal essentials are the things most clearly taught in scripture and most central to our faith in the gospel. They are the marks of orthodoxy which distinguish between the True Church and false churches. These are things which every Christian (and therefore every member of Sojourners) must believe.

In contrast, Doctrinal Distinctives are issues of doctrine that Christians can disagree on. At Sojourners, we believe our position on these distinctives best represents the teaching of Scripture. Nevertheless, orthodox Christians can disagree with our position. For example, many who hold to our understanding of Regeneration (Article 3 - Section 1 - #6), would disagree with our stance on Believer's Baptism (Article 3 - Section 2 - #5), because they believe the Scripture teaches differently concerning Baptism.

Notice as well that all Sojourners Members are expected to hold to the positions in our Doctrinal Essentials. But only elders (as the teachers of the church) are required to hold to our Doctrinal Distinctives. Members may disagree with Doctrinal Distinctives as long as they agree to remain non-divisive and to joyfully submit to the teaching of the elders. Such submission does not require adopting a different doctrinal stance, but it should include a willingness to sit under and trust the teaching of the elders week by week without continually opposing the elders' teaching.

## Other Statements of Doctrine

Notice second sections 3 and 4. Section 3 is our statement on Marriage, Gender, and Sexuality. These things are under tremendous pressure in our culture today. At the core of this attack is a desire to suppress the truth of God plain in his creation ([Rom 1:18–23](https://ref.ly/Rom%201.18%E2%80%9323;esv?t=biblia)). By distorting God's design for marriage, gender, and sexuality, our culture is ultimately rejecting God. Because these issues are so pressing, churches must take a clear biblical stand. Therefore, we have included this statement to make our position on the Bible's teaching clear.

Section 4 refers to the Elder Affirmation of Faith. This is the fullest expression of the doctrine of Sojourners Church. For our Elder Affirmation of Faith, we have adopted the Bethlehem College and Seminary Affirmation of Faith. This affirmation faithfully summarizes our understanding of what the Bible teaches. Members are not required to agree with everything in this statement of faith, but elders at Sojourners will teach according to the standards of doctrine found there.
