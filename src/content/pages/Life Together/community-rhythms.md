# Community Rhythms

As a church community gathered by and around the gospel of Jesus Christ, we believe that we need each other to fight the fight of faith. Following Jesus is not a solo journey. In [Colossians 3:12–17](https://ref.ly/Col%203.12%E2%80%9317;esv?t=biblia), Paul describes the kind of community we aim for: _“Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.”_

We aim for this kind of gospel intentionality in all of life. Therefore, our community is organized around community rhythms—our habits of gathering together.

Currently, our rhythms include:

*   Sunday Worship Gatherings (10 am Sundays)
    
*   Sunday School (9 am Sundays)
    
*   Wednesday Night Bible Study (5:30 pm Wedenesdays)
