# Sunday Worship

Each Sunday, we meet together as Sojourners Church. Our gathering is a family gathering, and we love to have company join us. Come in comfortable clothes and with an open heart. Come, taste and see that the Lord is good and magnify his name with us (Psalm 34)!

## What are your services like?

Our worship service starts at 10am. A member or pastor will welcome us, lead us in reading a call to worship from scripture, and pray for our service. We have a gospel-shaped liturgy that includes scripture readings, prayer, and songs. [You can read more about our liturgy here.](https://www.sojourners.church/writings?tag=Sojourners%20Church%20Liturgy) We sing a mix of contemporary and traditional songs. Many of our favorites come from [Sovereign Grace Music](https://sovereigngracemusic.org/) and [Getty Music](https://www.gettymusic.com/).

We are committed to expository preaching, therefore the pastor typically preaches a 35 minute message from whatever text of scripture we are studying together. [You can find recent sermons here.](https://www.sojourners.church/sermons)

After the sermon, we celebrate communion together each week. The formal part of our serve ends with a benediction, but many folks like to stick around and visit after service or go eat together. The last Sunday of every month, we eat a potluck meal together after the service.

## Where do kids go during service?

We believe worshipping together as a family is gift and our people are used to kids being kids during the service, so we celebrate and welcome children in our worship service.

We know some parents may not be used to having children with them during the service. To help parents with small children, we offer two options. First, we provide a section of the sanctuary with small chairs and a table for little ones to sit at and play or color. Second, parents are welcome to use our facilities across the hall as a restless child area (parental supervision is required). Age appropriate toys as well as audio and video from the service are provided.

A nursing mothers’ room with audio and video from the service is also available near the back of the sanctuary.

## Do you have Sunday School?

We have age appropriate Sunday School programming for Pre-K through adult during the school year. We meet together every Sunday before the service from 9am – 9:45 am.

## Where are you located?

We meet in the Skyline Plaza mall on the opposite side of the mall from Bomgaars and the Moose Lodge. Our address is 1679 Main Street, Skyline Plaza, Albert Lea, MN 56007. You can drive through the mall parking lot, but the easiest way to find us is to enter the mall parking lot on the south side of the building (off Front Street). If you see Sibley Elementary School across the street, you are on the right side of the mall. Our entrance looks like this:
