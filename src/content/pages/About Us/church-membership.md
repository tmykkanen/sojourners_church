## On Membership

<div>

All people who confess faith on the Lord Jesus Christ as personal Savior and now seek to follow him as Lord are members of the universal church. Yet, we affirm that God wills the universal church to find expression in local churches. Such churches are marked by believers gathered together in covenant with God and one another and united by a personal and common confession of faith in Jesus Christ. Our method of walking out the priority of the local church is through formalized church membership.

Each member of Sojourners Church is privileged and expected to participate in and contribute to the ministry and life of the church, consistent with God’s leading and with the gifts, time, and material resources each has received from God. In doing so, each member enjoys the benefits of a spiritual family who will support, encourage, and hold them accountable in their walk with Christ. Each member also enjoys the spiritual care of Christ-centered elders devoted to praying for, protecting, teaching, and equipping them—for each member’s joy and progress in the faith and as elders who will give an account before God for each member’s soul.

Membership at Sojourners Church is most fully defined in our [_Constitution and Bylaws_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggsuzTeH6kKD8kG-8Do2YO4YgIE_xN-B/view?usp=sharing) (adopted June 20, 2021).
