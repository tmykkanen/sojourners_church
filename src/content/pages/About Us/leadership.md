**_Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. -_** [**_Acts 20:28_**](https://ref.ly/Acts%2020.28;esv?t=biblia)

We believe that the local church should be led by a plurality of qualified elders. Sojourners Church has three elders that provide theological direction and teaching to the body of believers that they will one day give an account for. All elders are equal in authority and have different gifts, experiences, and abilities.

Tyler Mykkanen is Pastor for Preaching at Sojourners Church. He and his wife Nicole have been married since 2003 and have three children (Malachi, Ruby, and Ella). Tyler worked as a special education teacher for eight years before attending seminary at Bethlehem College and Seminary in Minneapolis, MN. He graduated with his MDiv in the spring of 2018 and joined Sojourners in September 2018.

The Mykkanens love practicing hospitality and camping in Minnesota's great state parks. Tyler is an Apple fanboy, technology geek, and collects modern board games.

Tyler's goal in ministry at Sojourners is to help others trust Jesus, love Jesus, and pursue joy in Jesus together. He proclaims Jesus with the goal of presenting everyone mature in Christ, working with the energy that Jesus works in him by the Spirit ([Col 1:28–29](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Col%201.28%E2%80%9329)).
