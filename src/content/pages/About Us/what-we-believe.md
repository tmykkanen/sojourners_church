## Foundation, Purpose, and Chief Priority

The **foundation** of this church is the Lord Jesus Christ, and its final arbiter in all its affairs is the Bible—the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments—which we believe is the Word of Almighty God.

The **purpose** of this church and the reason for its existence is to glorify God. We believe that God is most glorified in us as we learn to hope in Him and be satisfied in Him alone and as we share our hope and satisfaction with others.

Therefore, our **chief priority** aimed at fulfilling our purpose is to be and make eternally joyful disciples of Jesus Christ. We do this by worshipping God according to the teaching of His Word; by practicing the precepts and examples of the church of our Lord Jesus Christ as set forth in the Scriptures; by sustaining the church’s ordinances and doctrines; and by preaching and propagating among all peoples the Gospel of Salvation which is by personal faith on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.

Below, you will find several summaries of what we believe. These statements can also be found in our [_Constitution and Bylaws_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggsuzTeH6kKD8kG-8Do2YO4YgIE_xN-B/view?usp=sharing) (adopted June 20, 2021).

## Doctrinal Essentials

The _Doctrinal Essentials_ of Sojourners Church reflect the central, non-negotiable teachings of orthodox Christianity throughout history as derived from the Scriptures. These beliefs are rooted in Scripture and reaffirmed in various creeds throughout church history. All members of Sojourners Church must affirm these _Doctrinal Essentials_. Our _Doctrinal Essentials_ are as follows:

1.  **The Word of God** - We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and that it has supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct. ([_2 Timothy 3:16_](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%203.16;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Peter 1:20_](https://ref.ly/2%20Pet%201.20;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_21_](https://ref.ly/2%20Peter%201.21;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Mark 13:31_](https://ref.ly/Mark%2013.31;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 8:31_](https://ref.ly/John%208.31;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_32_](https://ref.ly/John%208.32;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 20:31_](https://ref.ly/John%2020.31;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 20:32_](https://ref.ly/Acts%2020.32;esv?t=biblia))
    
2.  **The Trinity** - We believe that there is one living and true God, eternally existing in three persons; that these are equal in every divine perfection, and that they execute distinct but harmonious offices in the work of creation, providence and redemption. ([_Genesis 1:1_](https://ref.ly/Gen%201.1;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_26_](https://ref.ly/Genesis%201.26;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 1:1_](https://ref.ly/John%201.1;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_3_](https://ref.ly/John%201.3;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Matthew 28:19_](https://ref.ly/Matt%2028.19;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 4:24_](https://ref.ly/John%204.24;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 1:19_](https://ref.ly/Rom%201.19;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_20_](https://ref.ly/Romans%201.20;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ephesians 4:5_](https://ref.ly/Eph%204.5;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_6_](https://ref.ly/Ephesians%204.6;esv?t=biblia))
    
3.  **God the Father** - We believe in God the Father, an infinite, personal spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love. We believe that He infallibly foreknows all that shall come to pass, that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayer, and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ. ([_Luke 10:21_](https://ref.ly/Luke%2010.21;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_22_](https://ref.ly/Luke%2010.22;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Matthew 23:9_](https://ref.ly/Matt%2023.9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 3:16_](https://ref.ly/John%203.16;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_6:27_](https://ref.ly/John%206.27;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 1:7_](https://ref.ly/Rom%201.7;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Timothy 1:1_](https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%201.1;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_2_](https://ref.ly/1%20Timothy%201.2;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2:5_](https://ref.ly/1%20Timothy%202.5;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_6_](https://ref.ly/1%20Timothy%202.6;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Peter 1:3_](https://ref.ly/1%20Pet%201.3;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Revelation 1:6_](https://ref.ly/Rev%201.6;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
4.  **Jesus Christ** - We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to earth. ([_Matthew 1:18-25_](https://ref.ly/Matt%201.18-25;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Luke 1:26-38_](https://ref.ly/Luke%201.26-38;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 1:1_](https://ref.ly/John%201.1;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_20:28_](https://ref.ly/John%2020.28;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 9:5_](https://ref.ly/Rom%209.5;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_8:32_](https://ref.ly/Romans%208.32;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Corinthians 5:21_](https://ref.ly/2%20Cor%205.21;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Peter 2:21-23_](https://ref.ly/1%20Pet%202.21-23;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 20:30_](https://ref.ly/John%2020.30;esv?t=biblia)_,_ [_31_](https://ref.ly/John%2020.31;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Matthew 20:28_](https://ref.ly/Matt%2020.28;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ephesians 1:4_](https://ref.ly/Eph%201.4;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 1:11_](https://ref.ly/Acts%201.11;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 5:6-8_](https://ref.ly/Rom%205.6-8;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_6:9_](https://ref.ly/Romans%206.9;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_10_](https://ref.ly/Romans%206.10;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Hebrews 7:25_](https://ref.ly/Heb%207.25;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Hebrews 9:28_](https://ref.ly/Heb%209.28;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Timothy 3:16_](https://ref.ly/1%20Tim%203.16;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
5.  **The Holy Spirit** - We believe in the Holy Spirit who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe in Jesus Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher and guide. ([_John 14:16_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.16;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_17_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.17;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_26_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.26;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_15:26_](https://ref.ly/John%2015.26;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_27_](https://ref.ly/John%2015.27;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 16:9-14_](https://ref.ly/John%2016.9-14;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 8:9_](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Corinthians 3:16_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%203.16;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_6:19_](https://ref.ly/1%20Corinthians%206.19;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Galatians 5:22-26_](https://ref.ly/Gal%205.22-26;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
6.  **Regeneration** - We believe that man was created by God in His own image; that he sinned and thereby incurred physical, spiritual and eternal death, which is separation from God; that as a consequence, all human beings are born with a sinful nature and are sinners by choice and therefore under condemnation. We believe that those who are regenerated by the Holy Spirit become new creatures, repent and forsake sin and trust Jesus Christ as Savior, and are delivered from condemnation and receive eternal life. ([_Genesis 1:26_](https://ref.ly/Gen%201.26;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_5:2_](https://ref.ly/Genesis%205.2;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Genesis 3_](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/genesis/3)_;_ [_Genesis 2:17_](https://ref.ly/Gen%202.17;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_3:19_](https://ref.ly/Genesis%203.19;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ecclesiastes 2:11_](https://ref.ly/Eccles%202.11;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 3:14_](https://ref.ly/John%203.14;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_5:24_](https://ref.ly/John%205.24;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 5:30_](https://ref.ly/John%205.30;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_7:13_](https://ref.ly/John%207.13;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_8:12_](https://ref.ly/John%208.12;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_10:26_](https://ref.ly/John%2010.26;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 9:22_](https://ref.ly/Rom%209.22;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Thessalonians 1:9_](https://ref.ly/2%20Thess%201.9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Revelation 19:3_](https://ref.ly/Rev%2019.3;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_20_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2019.20;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_20:10_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2020.10;esv?t=biblia)_;_[_14_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2020.14;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_15_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2020.15;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_21:18_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2021.18;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Psalm 51:7_](https://ref.ly/Ps%2051.7;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Jeremiah 17:9_](https://ref.ly/Jer%2017.9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_James 1:14_](https://ref.ly/James%201.14;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 3:19_](https://ref.ly/Rom%203.19;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_5:19_](https://ref.ly/Romans%205.19;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Proverbs 28:13_](https://ref.ly/Prov%2028.13;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 John 1:9_](https://ref.ly/1%20John%201.9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 3:16_](https://ref.ly/John%203.16;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 1:13_](https://ref.ly/John%201.13;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Corinthians 5:17_](https://ref.ly/2%20Cor%205.17;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 8:1_](https://ref.ly/Rom%208.1;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
7.  **The Church** - We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Christ is the head and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Spirit, and associated for worship, work, and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world. ([_1 Corinthians 3:11_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%203.11;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ephesians 2:19-22_](https://ref.ly/Eph%202.19-22;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 1:8_](https://ref.ly/Acts%201.8;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ephesians 5:19-21_](https://ref.ly/Eph%205.19-21;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 2:42_](https://ref.ly/Acts%202.42;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Hebrews 10:23-25_](https://ref.ly/Heb%2010.23-25;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
8.  **Christian Conduct** - We believe that a Christian should live for the glory of God and the well-being of his fellow men; that his conduct should be blameless before the world; that he should be a faithful steward of his possessions; and that he should seek to realize for himself and others the full stature of maturity in Christ. ([_1 Corinthians 10:31_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%2010.31;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 12:1-3_](https://ref.ly/Rom%2012.1-3;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Hebrews 12:1-2_](https://ref.ly/Heb%2012.1-2;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 14:15_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.15;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_23-24_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.23-24;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 John 2:3-6_](https://ref.ly/1%20John%202.3-6;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Corinthians 9:6-9_](https://ref.ly/2%20Cor%209.6-9;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Corinthians 4:2_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%204.2;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Colossians 1:9-10_](https://ref.ly/Col%201.9-10;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Genesis 1:27-28_](https://ref.ly/Gen%201.27-28;esv?t=biblia)_,_ [_2:23-25_](https://ref.ly/Genesis%202.23-25;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
9.  **The Ordinances** - We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has committed two ordinances to the local church, baptism and the Lord's Supper. We believe that these two ordinances should be observed and administered until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. ([_Matthew 28:18-20_](https://ref.ly/Matt%2028.18-20;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Romans 6:3-5_](https://ref.ly/Rom%206.3-5;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Corinthians 11:23-26_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%2011.23-26;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
10.  **The Last Things** - We believe in the personal and visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth and the establishment of His kingdom. We believe in the resurrection of the body, the final judgement, the eternal joy of the righteous and the endless suffering of the wicked. ([_Matthew 16:27_](https://ref.ly/Matt%2016.27;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Mark 14:62_](https://ref.ly/Mark%2014.62;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_John 14:3_](https://ref.ly/John%2014.3;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 1:11_](https://ref.ly/Acts%201.11;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Philippians 3:20_](https://ref.ly/Phil%203.20;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Thessalonians 4:15_](https://ref.ly/1%20Thess%204.15;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_2 Timothy 4:1_](https://ref.ly/2%20Tim%204.1;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Titus 2:13_](https://ref.ly/Titus%202.13;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Corinthians 4:5_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%204.5;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_1 Corinthians 15_](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1-corinthians/15)_;_ [_2 Thessalonians 1:7-10_](https://ref.ly/2%20Thess%201.7-10;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Revelation 20:4-6_](https://ref.ly/Rev%2020.4-6;esv?t=biblia)_,_[_11-15_](https://ref.ly/Revelation%2020.11-15;esv?t=biblia)_)_
     

## Doctrinal Distinctives

Sojourners Church is committed to several _Doctrinal Distinctives_ that, unlike our _Doctrinal Essentials_, are not embraced by all orthodox Christians. Nevertheless, we believe that these distinctives represent our best understanding of Scripture, so our elders passionately preach, teach, and counsel members of the church in harmony with these distinctives. Our members also agree to remain non-divisive over these issues by joyful submission to the teaching of the elders. We affirm the following _Doctrinal Distinctives_:

1.  **The sovereignty of God over the individual in salvation.** _(_[_Romans 9:14-23_](https://ref.ly/Rom%209.14-23;esv?t=biblia)_; Ephesians 1-2)_
    
2.  **The pursuit of our fullest joy in the glory of God through Christ** \[“Christian Hedonism”\]. _(_[_Psalm 37:4_](https://ref.ly/Ps%2037.4;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Philippians 1:21-23_](https://ref.ly/Phil%201.21-23;esv?t=biblia)_,_ [_3:1-11_](https://ref.ly/Philippians%203.1-11;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
3.  **Local church rule by a plurality of elders.** _(_[_1 Peter 5:1-2_](https://ref.ly/1%20Pet%205.1-2;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Acts 14:23_](https://ref.ly/Acts%2014.23;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Titus 1:5_](https://ref.ly/Titus%201.5;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
4.  **Complementary roles for men and women in the church and home.** _(Genesis 1-2;_ [_Ephesians 5:22-33_](https://ref.ly/Eph%205.22-33;esv?t=biblia)_; 1 Timothy 3)_
    
5.  **Believer’s baptism and communion.** _(_[_Jeremiah 31:31-34_](https://ref.ly/Jer%2031.31-34;esv?t=biblia)_;_ [_Ezekiel 36:26-28_](https://ref.ly/Ezek%2036.26-28;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
6.  **The spiritually nourishing presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper.** _(_[_1 Corinthians 10:16-17_](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%2010.16-17;esv?t=biblia)_)_
    
7.  **Desire, discernment, and decency in the use of all the spiritual gifts.** _(1 Corinthians 12-14)_
    

## Elder Affirmation of Faith

Sojourners Church is grateful for Bethlehem College and Seminary in providing theological education for a number of our elders. We have adopted, with permission, the [_Bethlehem College and Seminary Affirmation of Faith_](https://drive.google.com/a/sojourners.church/file/d/1hWhmLwRf-Yq2bLts8OU28TK0eiqPLzDs/view?usp=sharing) (right-click the link to save a copy). This 52-page document is the fullest expression of our beliefs at Sojourners Church.

## Statement on Marriage, Gender, & Sexuality

We believe that God creates each person as male or female. These two distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image and nature of God ([Genesis 1:26-27](https://ref.ly/Gen%201.26-27;esv?t=biblia)). Rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person.

We believe that the term “marriage” has only one meaning: the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive union, as delineated in Scripture ([Genesis 2:18-25](https://ref.ly/Gen%202.18-25;esv?t=biblia)). We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other ([1 Corinthians 6:18](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%206.18;esv?t=biblia); [7:2-5](https://ref.ly/1%20Corinthians%207.2-5;esv?t=biblia); [Hebrews 13:4](https://ref.ly/Heb%2013.4;esv?t=biblia)). We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.

We believe that any form of sexual immorality (including adultery, fornication, homosexual behavior, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, and use of pornography) is sinful and offensive to God ([Matthew 15:18-20](https://ref.ly/Matt%2015.18-20;esv?t=biblia); [1 Corinthians 6:9-10](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%206.9-10;esv?t=biblia)).

We believe that in order to preserve the function and integrity of Sojourners Church as the local Body of Christ, and to provide a biblical role model to our members and the community, it is imperative that all persons employed by Sojourners Church in any capacity, or who serve as volunteers, agree to and abide by this _Statement on Marriage, Gender, and Sexuality_ ([Matthew 5:16](https://ref.ly/Matt%205.16;esv?t=biblia); [Philippians 2:14-16](https://ref.ly/Phil%202.14-16;esv?t=biblia); [1 Thessalonians 5:22](https://ref.ly/1%20Thess%205.22;esv?t=biblia)).

We believe that God offers redemption and restoration to all who confess and forsake their sin, seeking His mercy and forgiveness through Jesus Christ ([Acts 3:19-21](https://ref.ly/Acts%203.19-21;esv?t=biblia); [Romans 10:9-10](https://ref.ly/Rom%2010.9-10;esv?t=biblia); [1 Corinthians 6:9-11](https://ref.ly/1%20Cor%206.9-11;esv?t=biblia)).

We believe that every person must be afforded compassion, love, kindness, respect, and dignity ([Mark 12:28-31](https://ref.ly/Mark%2012.28-31;esv?t=biblia); [Luke 6:31](https://ref.ly/Luke%206.31;esv?t=biblia)). Hateful and harassing behavior or attitudes directed toward any individual are to be repudiated and are not in accord with Scripture nor the doctrines of Sojourners Church.
