## Foundation, Purpose, and Chief Priority

The **purpose** of this church and the reason for its existence is to glorify God. We believe that God is most glorified in us as we learn to hope in Him and be satisfied in Him alone and as we share our hope and satisfaction with others.

This is a paragraph

Therefore, our **chief priority** aimed at fulfilling our purpose is to be and make eternally joyful disciples of Jesus Christ. We do this by worshipping God according to the teaching of His Word; by practicing the precepts and examples of the church of our Lord Jesus Christ as set forth in the Scriptures; by sustaining the church’s ordinances and doctrines; and by preaching and propagating among all peoples the Gospel of Salvation which is by personal faith on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. Below, you will find several summaries of what we believe. These statements can also be found in our \[\_Constitution and Bylaws\_\]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggsuzTeH6kKD8kG-8Do2YO4YgIE\\\_xN-B/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggsuzTeH6kKD8kG-8Do2YO4YgIE%5C_xN-B/view?usp=sharing)) (adopted June 20, 2021).
