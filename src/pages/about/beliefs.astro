      <h2>Foundation, Purpose, and Chief Priority</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The <span class="font-bold">foundation</span> of this church is the Lord
          Jesus Christ, and its final arbiter in all its affairs is the Bible—the
          Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments—which we believe is the Word
          of Almighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="font-bold">purpose</span> of this church and the reason
          for its existence is to glorify God. We believe that God is most glorified
          in us as we learn to hope in Him and be satisfied in Him alone and as we
          share our hope and satisfaction with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, our <span class="font-bold">chief priority</span> aimed at fulfilling
          our purpose is to be and make eternally joyful disciples of Jesus Christ.
          We do this by worshipping God according to the teaching of His Word; by
          practicing the precepts and examples of the church of our Lord Jesus Christ
          as set forth in the Scriptures; by sustaining the church’s ordinances and
          doctrines; and by preaching and propagating among all peoples the Gospel
          of Salvation which is by personal faith on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, you will find several summaries of what we believe. These
          statements can also be found in our <a

      <h2>Doctrinal Essentials</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The <span class="italic">Doctrinal Essentials</span> of Sojourners Church
          reflect the central, non-negotiable teachings of orthodox Christianity
          throughout history as derived from the Scriptures. These beliefs are rooted
          in Scripture and reaffirmed in various creeds throughout church history.
          All members of Sojourners Church must affirm these <span
            class="italic">Doctrinal Essentials</span
          >. Our <span class="italic">Doctrinal Essentials</span> are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>The Word of God</span> - We believe that the Bible is the Word
            of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts,
            written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and that it has supreme
            authority in all matters of faith and conduct. (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter
            1:20,21; Mark 13:31; John 8:31,32; John 20:31; Acts 20:32)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The Trinity</span> - We believe that there is one living and true
            God, eternally existing in three persons; that these are equal in every
            divine perfection, and that they execute distinct but harmonious offices
            in the work of creation, providence and redemption. (Genesis 1:1,26;
            John 1:1,3; Matthew 28:19; John 4:24; Romans 1:19,20; Ephesians 4:5,6)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>God the Father</span> - We believe in God the Father, an infinite,
            personal spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love. We believe
            that He infallibly foreknows all that shall come to pass, that He concerns
            Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayer,
            and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus
            Christ. (Luke 10:21,22; Matthew 23:9; John 3:16; 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1
            Timothy 1:1,2; 2:5,6; 1 Peter 1:3; Revelation 1:6)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Jesus Christ</span> - We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only begotten
            Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless
            life, miracles, and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning
            death, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession
            for His people, and personal visible return to earth. (Matthew 1:18-25;
            Luke 1:26-38; John 1:1; 20:28; Romans 9:5; 8:32; 2 Corinthians 5:21;
            1 Peter 2:21-23; John 20:30, 31; Matthew 20:28; Ephesians 1:4; Acts 1:11;
            Romans 5:6-8; 6:9,10; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 9:28; 1 Timothy 3:16)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The Holy Spirit</span> - We believe in the Holy Spirit who came
            forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness,
            and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe
            in Jesus Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer
            in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher and guide. (John
            14:16,17,26; 15:26,27; John 16:9-14; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 3:16;
            6:19; Galatians 5:22-26)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Regeneration</span> - We believe that man was created by God in
            His own image; that he sinned and thereby incurred physical, spiritual
            and eternal death, which is separation from God; that as a consequence,
            all human beings are born with a sinful nature and are sinners by choice
            and therefore under condemnation. We believe that those who are regenerated
            by the Holy Spirit become new creatures, repent and forsake sin and trust
            Jesus Christ as Savior, and are delivered from condemnation and receive
            eternal life. (Genesis 1:26; 5:2; Genesis 3; Genesis 2:17; 3:19; Ecclesiastes
            2:11; John 3:14; 5:24; John 5:30; 7:13; 8:12; 10:26; Romans 9:22; 2 Thessalonians
            1:9; Revelation 19:3,20; 20:10;14,15; 21:18; Psalm 51:7; Jeremiah 17:9;
            James 1:14; Romans 3:19; 5:19; Proverbs 28:13; 1 John 1:9; John 3:16;
            John 1:13; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Romans 8:1)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The Church</span> - We believe in the universal church, a living
            spiritual body of which Christ is the head and all regenerated persons
            are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company
            of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized in the name of the Father, Son
            and Spirit, and associated for worship, work, and fellowship. We believe
            that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task
            of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world. (1 Corinthians
            3:11; Ephesians 2:19-22; Acts 1:8; Ephesians 5:19-21; Acts 2:42; Hebrews
            10:23-25)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Christian Conduct</span> - We believe that a Christian should live
            for the glory of God and the well-being of his fellow men; that his conduct
            should be blameless before the world; that he should be a faithful steward
            of his possessions; and that he should seek to realize for himself and
            others the full stature of maturity in Christ. (1 Corinthians 10:31;
            Romans 12:1-3; Hebrews 12:1-2; John 14:15,23-24; 1 John 2:3-6; 2 Corinthians
            9:6-9; 1 Corinthians 4:2; Colossians 1:9-10; Genesis 1:27-28, 2:23-25)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The Ordinances</span> - We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has
            committed two ordinances to the local church, baptism and the Lord's
            Supper. We believe that these two ordinances should be observed and administered
            until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:18-20; Romans
            6:3-5; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26)
          </li>
          <li>
            The Last Things - We believe in the personal and visible return of
            the Lord Jesus Christ to earth and the establishment of His kingdom.
            We believe in the resurrection of the body, the final judgement, the
            eternal joy of the righteous and the endless suffering of the
            wicked. (Matthew 16:27; Mark 14:62; John 14:3; Acts 1:11;
            Philippians 3:20; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 2 Timothy 4:1; Titus 2:13; 1
            Corinthians 4:5; 1 Corinthians 15; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10;
            Revelation 20:4-6,11-15)

      <h2>Doctrinal Distinctives</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Sojourners Church is committed to several <span class="italic"
            >Doctrinal Distinctives</span
          > that, unlike our <span class="italic">Doctrinal Essentials,</span> are
          not embraced by all orthodox Christians. Nevertheless, we believe that
          these distinctives represent our best understanding of Scripture, so our
          elders passionately preach, teach, and counsel members of the church in
          harmony with these distinctives. Our members also agree to remain non-divisive
          over these issues by joyful submission to the teaching of the elders. We
          affirm the following <span class="italic">Doctrinal Distinctives</span
          >:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>The sovereignty of God over the individual in salvation.</span
            > (Romans 9:14-23; Ephesians 1-2)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              The pursuit of our fullest joy in the glory of God through Christ
              [“Christian Hedonism”].
            </span> (Psalm 37:4; Philippians 1:21-23, 3:1-11)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Local church rule by a plurality of elders.</span> (1 Peter 5:1-2;
            Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >Complementary roles for men and women in the church and home.</span
            >
            (Genesis 1-2; Ephesians 5:22-33; 1 Timothy 3)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Believer’s baptism and communion.</span> (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Ezekiel
            36:26-28)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >The spiritually nourishing presence of Christ in the Lord’s
              Supper.</span
            >
            (1 Corinthians 10:16-17)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              Desire, discernment, and decency in the use of all the spiritual
              gifts.

      <h2>Elder Affirmation of Faith</h2>
      <p>
        Sojourners Church is grateful for Bethlehem College and Seminary in
        providing theological education for a number of our elders. We have
        adopted, with permission, the Bethlehem College and Seminary Affirmation
        of Faith (right-click the link to save a copy). This 52-page document is
        the fullest expression of our beliefs at Sojourners Church.

      <h2>Statement on Marriage, Gender, & Sexuality</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          We believe that God creates each person as male or female. These two
          distinct, complementary genders together reflect the image and nature
          of God (Genesis 1:26-27). Rejection of one’s biological sex is a
          rejection of the image of God within that person.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that the term “marriage” has only one meaning: the uniting
          of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive union, as delineated
          in Scripture (Genesis 2:18-25). We believe that God intends sexual
          intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to
          each other (1 Corinthians 6:18; 7:2-5; Hebrews 13:4). We believe that
          God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in
          outside of a marriage between a man and a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that any form of sexual immorality (including adultery,
          fornication, homosexual behavior, bisexual conduct, bestiality,
          incest, and use of pornography) is sinful and offensive to God
          (Matthew 15:18-20; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10).
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that in order to preserve the function and integrity of
          Sojourners Church as the local Body of Christ, and to provide a
          biblical role model to our members and the community, it is imperative
          that all persons employed by Sojourners Church in any capacity, or who
          serve as volunteers, agree to and abide by this Statement on Marriage,
          Gender, and Sexuality (Matthew 5:16; Philippians 2:14-16; 1
          Thessalonians 5:22).
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that God offers redemption and restoration to all who
          confess and forsake their sin, seeking His mercy and forgiveness
          through Jesus Christ (Acts 3:19-21; Romans 10:9-10; 1 Corinthians
          6:9-11).
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that every person must be afforded compassion, love,
          kindness, respect, and dignity (Mark 12:28-31; Luke 6:31). Hateful and
          harassing behavior or attitudes directed toward any individual are to
          be repudiated and are not in accord with Scripture nor the doctrines
          of Sojourners Church.
